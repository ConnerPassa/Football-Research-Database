# Football Research Database

Welcome to the **Football Research Database** repository!

---

### **Introduction**

This database is the first step in a larger obsession to understand the game at its core. It takes in data from a number of sources including, the nfl_data_py python package, Pro Football Focus premium stats, and OverTheCap.com contracts data.

The goal is intelligence. Much like the SABRmetricians with baseball, I am trying to learn about football through the lens of numbers. Is QB X overrated? Is QB Y undervalued? These are the types of questions i am trying to answer.

### **What You'll Find Inside**

**1. Sample Datasets**

  I will provide the sample datasets from publicly available sources like nfl_data_py. I will not be sharing the PFF data sources because they must be paid for. 

**2. Scripts**

  In this folder, you will find by SQL and Python scripts. 
  
  The SQL scripts in this folder will be mostly related to CREATE TABLES, BULK INSERTS, and cleaning of the raw data thats uploaded. 

  The Python scripts will be calculations of advanced statistics like expected points added, completion percentage over expected, and success rates.

**3. Sample Queries**

  In this section, there will be numerous SQL queries for finding information about the game. These will display a mastery of SQL querying to find the answers to the questions asked.

  SQL tools used include:

  1. Subqueries
  2. Joins
  3. Common Table Expressions
  4. Window Functions
  5. Case-When statements
