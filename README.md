Welcome to the **Football Research Database** repository!

### Introduction

This database is the first step in a larger obsession to understand the game at its core. It takes in data from a number of sources including, the nfl_data_py python package, Pro Football Focus premium stats, and OverTheCap.com contracts data.

The goal is intelligence. Much like the SABRmetricians with baseball, I am trying to learn about football through the lens of numbers. Is QB X overrated? Is QB Y undervalued?  


Resources used:
